<h1>Q&A</h1>
<p>1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?</p>
<p>The most challenging part for me in this assignment was the overall design. It is hard for me to imagine the page structures of website from zero. So it was challenging for me and took me 5 days to complete.</p>

<p>What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?</p>
<p>I used "media" to monitor the screen width. There are four conditions of the width. And for each condition, I wrote different CSS styles.</p>

<p>
What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?</p>
<p>When I designed my website, I considered user experience as the most important part. I chose a cosistent color for my websites. I think it will give users a better experience when they visit my website.</p>

<p>
Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? </p>
<p>In the future, I would like to add more functions to my website with JavaScript. For example, I would like to fold my navigation bar instead of making it smaller when the screen width changes. Also, I'd like to add some interactions in the future.</p>

<p>How many hours did you spend on this assignment?</p>
<p>I spent about 2 hours every day to do this assignment. And it took me 5 days in total. Apart from coding, I also revised some knowledge about the HTML and CSS.</p>
